<!--![Astro Paper](public/astropaper-og.jpg)-->

My name is Ko Loy Yee, or David. I spent over 10 years in the kitchen, rising from cook to head chef, but now it is time to move on. Today, I am a programmer. Rather than creating dishes to entertain guests, I now build software to enrich my users' lives.

I am a shameless Apple fanboy and a devotee of the ecosystem. You’ll find most of my posts are about Apple, Swift, and mobile app development.

Apart from Swift, I am a huge fan of Clojure—not just for the functional programming, but for the ethos, design, and community created by Rich Hickey.

I look forward to sharing my software with everyone—creating artifacts that make users' lives easier, happier, more productive, and smarter.
