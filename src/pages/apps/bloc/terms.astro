        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
          By downloading, accessing, or using Bloc (the "App"), you agree to these Terms of
          Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the App.

        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
          You may use the App only if you can legally form a binding contract in your country or
          region. If you are under the age of majority where you live, you must have permission
          from a parent or legal guardian.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some jurisdictions restrict services for children (for example, under 13 in the U.S. or
          under 16 in parts of the EU). If you allow all ages, you may still need a separate
          child-specific policy and safeguards.
